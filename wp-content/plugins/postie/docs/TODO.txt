Option to not process forwarded emails (getPostAuthorDetails)
Separate out video linkifying from normal url linkifying - separate settings
Add Message-ID header value to custom field (postie_message_id?) to both posts and comments.
Use In-Reply-To header value as a better way to detect replies
Verify that {TITLE} is doing the right thing.

Shortcodes
Note: Postie will need to temporarily save the global $shortcode_tags variable off to the side, register its own
shortcodes (action for user supplied shortcodes?) process the emails then restore the global $shortcode_tags.

=========
Revised parsing logic

convert all logic to filters
before session filter
before mail filter
email/account filter
attachment filter
iterate through each html element (p, div, etc) and apply all filters and buffer output
after mail filter
after session filter

convert plain text to html using same logic as wp - i.e. all text is html
Original text is never modified
There are filters that modify
  meta data (tags, categories, date)
  content (start, end, newlines, linkifying)
=========
AddOn Ideas
(done) Google Alerts - turn each alert into a post
(done) HTML cleaning - use http://htmlpurifier.org/ to convert Word Html and other bad html into standard html

=========

  Use standard shortcode syntax. I.e. [postie date="Jan 1, 2014"]
